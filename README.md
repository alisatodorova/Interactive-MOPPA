# "Interactive multi-objective path planning algorithm for accessible sidewalks"
## Bachelor Thesis by Alisa Todorova

## Context
My Bachelor thesis and research has been done in the context of a research internship at the Urban Innovation and R&D department of the City of Amsterdam.
The motivation behind my research is to make Amsterdam more accessible. The end goal of the big project that my research is part of, is to create a highly user-dependent app for Amsterdam citizens with mobility issues and those who use assistive devices (i.e., wheelchairs, strollers, canes). 
This app should find the user the most accessible sidewalks, with respect to their specific needs. 

I propose a new method that leverages the power of Gaussian Processes and an interactive approach to quickly generate likely preferred solutions (i.e., paths) without computing the entire Pareto Front.
